Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS) is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) solution offerd by Informatica.  It allows organizations to integrate, synchronize and relate all data applications and processes that reside on premesis or in the cloud. In this solution, it will leverage azure virtual machine compute resources as well as private virtual network and private endpoint to run Infaagent installed on the VM to process and manage master and reference data.  

Integration Cloud, a component of Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services, is offered as an iPaaS  that provides near universal access to application data regardless of its location, format, or origin and integrates applications and application processes regardless of where they are deployed. Integration Cloud provides the ability to move and migrate existing enterprise business applications to public and private cloud solutions as well as allowing for continued co-existence with on-premises applications and systems. It supports on-going co-existence integration needs as businesses shift some or all applications to cloud solutions over time. 

IICS is made of several data management products with common interface to accelerate productivity.  IICS can be access from any machine with an internet access and web browser application.   

IICS functions allows users to: 

- Import or migrate data between data sources. 

- Perform object synchronization to create a copy of data on multiple applications. 

- Design process integration to connect multiple processes. 

- Replicate data between data sources for backup and archiving purposes.
